# Calculator.py
# Python 3.7.3 64-bit

This is an assignment where I had to make a creative calculator.

I ask the user to give me a number representing how many eggs they can hold.
I then ask the user to give me a number repreesnting how many eggs a kid can hold.

From there I wrote a staement to get an input, giving me a way to narrow down what they want to do.
Depending on what the user picks you can add, subtract, or divide the eggs.
I also added an option where if you didnt pick one of the 4 prompts it will ask you to try again

After they pick and it runs through the if statments it will print out a little message with the numbers added, subtracted, or divided.
